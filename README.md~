# NodeMCU Tank control with gamepad over HTTP on Wifi access point

![Alt text](relative/path/to/tank.jpg?raw=true "Tank")

## Software outline

`web2.lua` uses `httpserver.lua` to create a web server that 1) serves the web page with the JavaScript for control
and 2) handles a single command with joystick position updates.

`control.lua` converts the joystick coordinates to motor speeds and `motors.lua` uses the `pwm` modules to set the
speed and direction of the motors.

`wifi.lua` sets up a local wifi access point with ip address `192.168..1.2`
